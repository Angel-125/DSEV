description = The new DSEV tank team at Wild Blue Industries continues their crusade against the old fuel tanks. The took the existing WB-120 pellet tank and turned it into a storage tank that can hold multiple types of different resources. They even appropriately named it to reflect its true storage capacity. Engineers also verified that the capsule is too big to swallow. Just ignore the teeth marks.
