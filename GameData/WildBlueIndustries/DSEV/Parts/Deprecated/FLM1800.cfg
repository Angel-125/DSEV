manufacturer = Wild Blue Industries
description = A new team of engineers at Wild Blue Industries looked at the existing balloon tanks and shook their heads in disgust. This new tank is designed to hold a variety of different resources and is sized to fit standard truss segments. It can be tweaked both before launch and out in the field, to store a variety of different resources. It also has optional mounting brackets to allow it to be radially attached to a vessel, and it has optional sleeves to allow for vertical stacking.
