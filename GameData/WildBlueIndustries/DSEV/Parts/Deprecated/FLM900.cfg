description = A half-sized version of the FLM-1800, this tank is designed to hold a variety of different resources and is sized to fit half-sized truss segments. It can be tweaked both before launch and out in the field, to store a variety of different resources. It also has optional mounting brackets to allow it to be radially attached to a vessel, and it has optional sleeves to allow for vertical stacking.
