manufacturer = Wild Blue Industries
description = Originally created as the world's biggest spatula to cook the world's biggest pancake, its segmented design proved too flimsy to handle the load. But Wild Blue Industries saw its potential as a heat radiator for spacecraft and licensed the design. its cardboard-like construction allows coolant to flow through the hollow spaces. Engineers still insist that the "plasma screen" radiator IS made from cardboard despite proof of its graphene construction materials.
