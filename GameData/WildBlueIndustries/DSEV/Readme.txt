Copy the WildBlueIndustries directory into your GameData folder.

---REVISION HISTORY---

1.4.0
New Parts
- Added the WB-1 Camaro liquid fuel engine. Based on the KR-1 "Boar" from Porkjet's revamp engine's design sheet, the Camaro supports Standard (2.5m), Boat Tail (2.5m), Narrow (1.875m) and Compact (1.25m) engine mount sizes. It also supports engine thrust and ISP upgrades. The Camaro was a fun art study of how Squad creates its art assets and well worth the detour. If you want to see the rocket part revamp in game, tell Squad!

1.3.0
- Updated to KSP 1.2. Expect additional patches as KSP is fixed and mods are updated.

New Parts
- Added the T-Intersection Hex Truss. This 3-way hex truss is similar to the Hex Node, but it only has 3 attachment nodes.
- Added the Radial Hex Mount. This radially attached part provides a stack mount for your hex trusses.

Supernova
- Any class with the RepairSkill can now upgrade the Supernova.

Docking ports
- To fix a long standing problem with wobbly spacecraft, you can now weld HexPorts and 3.75m docking rings together. Your docked vessels become one craft. Combine with autostrut to make a solid craft. Once welded together, you can no longer undock the ports.
The Wild Blue tab under the Game Difficulty screen has the following options for docking port welding:
* Require an EVA to weld the ports (default: true): If false, you can weld the ports without requiring an EVA.
* Require the repair skill to weld ports (default: true): if false, anybody can perform the weld.
* Keep docking ports after the weld (default: false): If false, then after welding, the docking ports vanish and the parts are moved together to close the gap. If true, then the docking ports remain in place but will become unusable.
Thanks for showing me how its done, Shadowmage! :)

1.2.4
- Updated to latest WBT.

1.2.3
- Updated to latest WBT.
- You can now change the configration on tanks with symmetrical parts. In the SPH/VAB it will happen automatically when you select a new configuration. After launch, you'll have the option to change symmetrical tanks.

1.2.1
- If fuel tanks are arrayed symmetrically, you'll no longer be able to reconfigure them. It's either that or let the game explode (ie nothing I can do about it except prevent players from changing symmetrical tanks).

1.2.0
- Fixed an issue where the Hex Trusses weren't providing the hollow truss configuration.
- Fixed an issue where the Hex Trusses weren't allowing you to reconfigure the fuel tanks in their fuel tank configuration.
- Hex Trusses now use the standard dialog for configuring resources.
- All fuel tanks and trusses can now participate in Pathfinder's resource distribution system.

1.1.9
- Recompiled for latest WBT.

1.1.8
- Fixed radial attachment distances so that tanks will be flush with the part they're attached to.

1.1.7
- Updated to KSP 1.1.3

1.1.6
- Fixed Half Hex Truss support for CLS.

1.1.2
- Recompiled for KSP 1.1 release
- Updated to latest WildBlueTools

1.1.1
- Recompiled for latest KSP 1.1
- Storage containers now use new part module; you might need to hyperedit resources back in.

1.1.0 Refits
This release kicks off the DSEV overhaul project. It's intended to alleviate the performance issues found in previous versions of the mod and to update the artwork. Expect to see remodeling of the fuel tanks once I know how the new stock fuel tanks will look in KSP 1.2. 

In this release in particular, you'll find an improved hex truss system, 2.5m fuel tanks separated from 3.75m tanks, and 1.25m tanks separated from the 1.875m tanks. The 1.875m tanks have been retired. If you want 1.875m tanks in the future, try the newer Titan line from Mark One Laboratory Extensions. 
There's also a bonus in the form of an old engine brought back to life.

KSP 1.1
- Recompiled for KSP 1.1 pre-release

New Parts
- Re-introduced the nuclear aerospike as the WS-N7 "Viper" dual-mode nuclear aerospike. This advanced nuclear engine supports liquid fuel mode for good ISP and LFO mode for high thrust, and its aerospike gives it good ISP across a variety of atmospheric pressures.
- Added FLM-6400, FLM-3200, and FLM-1600 fuel tanks. These 2.5m tanks come in gold foil and stock-alike orange.
- Added FLM-400 and FLM-200 fuel tanks. These are 1.25m tanks.

Hex Truss System
- The Hex truss sytem has undergone remodeling, giving them an art style similar to the Buffalo's chassis system. You can now switch between a hollow truss with a variable number of equipment racks (same as before, just new models), a fuel tank that holds various resources, and a crew tunnel. There are four hex truss options available: double, full, half, and quarter.
- The Hex Node and Hex Adapter have also been remodeled.
NOTE: The older hex truss system models have been deprecated. Existing ships won't break, but you won't be able to build new ones with the older parts.

FLM-14400, 7200, 3600
- Due to issues with colliders, the 3.75m tanks have been refactored to remove their 2.5m counterparts. You can still switch between the stock-alike orange texture and the gold foil texture. Older tanks have been deprecated. Existing ships won't break, but you won't be able to build new ones with the older tanks.

FLM-450, FLM-900, FLM-1800
- Deprecated the 1.875m fuel tanks. Existing ships won't break, but you won't be able to build new ones with the older tanks.

1.0.6
- The Supernova will now properly allow you to upgrade the engine. You don't need Science when in Sandbox mode, but in all game modes, you do need a 5-star engineer.
- Adjusted the parts cost to upgrade the engine.

1.0.5

Bug Fixes
- The Supernova now recognizes that off means off.

Other
- Updated to KSP 1.0.5

1.0.4

- Fixed an issue where the Hex Adapter could be changed in flight.
- The Supernova can now be upgraded from inside the ship as well as while on EVA.

1.0 Second star on the right, and straight on until morning

- Fixed an issue with the hex adapter that let you change the size and style outside of the VAB/SPH.
- The 3.75m docking ring now properly responds to the Control From Here command.

1.0 RC3
- Added 2.5m-to-hextruss adapter, that can be toggled to a 3.75m-to-hextruss adapter.
- Fixed z-fighting issues with the part thumbnails in the editor.
- Fixed gaps in the fuel tank attachment nodes.

1.0 RC2
NOTE: Be sure to delete your old WildBlueIndustries' folder as files have moved around.

- Removed Cooldown heat management in favor of stock ModuleActiveRadiator. Since stock's heat management is ship-wide like Cooldown's system, you won't notice much of a difference. Radiators will still glow and you can still dump coolant. :)
- Retuned Supernova heat production for new stock heat mangement. It takes a dozen of the Graphene radiators to properly cool, just as before.
- Removed ModuleTargetTemp from the FLM fuel tanks. Stock parts now have the built-in radiatorMax, which is basically the same thing.
- Refactored folder structure for better CKAN support.
- Converted all storage decals to dds.

1.0 RC1: One Giant Leap
- Added ability to adjust the volume for the heat radiator coolant dump sound effect to the DSEV debug menu.
- Added persistence to the volume controls.
- Added the MM_DisableCooldown ModuleManager patch. To use it, rename MM_DisableCooldown.txt to MM_DisableCooldown.cfg. 
NOTE: Your radiators will no longer glow if you install this patch, but they will extend/retract.
- Added the MM_HeatControl ModuleManager patch. To use it, rename MM_HeatControl.txt to MM_HeatControl.cfg. 
NOTE: This will replace DSEV's Cooldown with Nertea's HeatControl, and requires HeatControl as a separate download.
- The Supernova's temperature readout will not be shown if MM_HeatControl or MM_DisableCooldown are installed.

How to use the Module Manager patches
DSEV comes with several Module Manager patches to alter the mod’s configuration to suit your play style. Several of them are applied automatically, while others are optional. You can find the patches in the DSEV root directory; they all start with MM_.

MM_CTT.cfg: This patch is used to integrate DSEV with the Community Tech Tree. It runs automatically if you have Community Tech Tree installed.

MM_HideHexTrusses.txt: This patch will hide the hex trusses, typically used if you install a similar system such as Nertea’s Near Future Construction. Simply rename the file from .txt to .cfg to enable it.

MM_LiquidFuel.txt: This patch switches the Supernova and ArcJet engine and RCS thrusters over to use LiquidFuel instead of LqdHydrogen. Simply rename the file from .txt to .cfg to enable it.

MM_Resources.cfg: This patch adds resource distributions to various planets in the game. It is applied automatically.

MM_TechTree.cfg: This patch adds the Experimental Fusion tech node to the technology tree. It is applied automatically if you don’t have Community Tech Tree installed.

MM_HeatControl.txt: This patch reconfigures the heat radiators so that they use Nertea’s HeatControl instead of using the Cooldown plugin installed with DSEV. Simply rename the file from .txt to .cfg to enable it.

MM_DisableCooldown.txt: An alternate patch, this will disable heat management altogether, and rely upon the game’s built-in mechanics to distribute the heat. If you use this patch, your radiators will no longer glow. Simply rename the file from .txt to .cfg to enable it. Do not use this patch if you are using MM_HeatControl.

0.3.25: Gold Standard

3.75m Service Bay
- The service bay now comes in two variants: Open Service Bay, and Service Compartment. The open-end variant has no doors that open, while the closed variant does.

Storage Tanks
- FLM-1440, 7200, and 3600 now all have an alternate gold foil look for both 3.75m and 2.5m sizes.
- Adjusted pricing on the FLM-1800 and FLM-900.
- You can now resize the FLM-1800 between 1.875m and 1.25m.
- You can now resize the FLM-900 between 1.875m, 1.25m, and 0.625m.

NOTE: FLM-7200 and FLM-3600 will get gold foil textures too, this is a work in progress.
- Added the 3.75m service bay. It has two modes of operation: open end-cap (default), and closed end cap. When closed, you can toggle the service bay doors.

0.3.23: Warp Speed
- Minor bug fixes to the resource switcher.
- The FLM-100 now has the correct resources. Thanks for the investigation rabidningawombat! :)
- Refactored templates so that they can be shared across Wild Blue Industry mods.

0.3.22: The Final Frontier

Templates
- Added the MonoPropellant template.

Supernova
- Individual engines now require RocketParts and Science to unlock Pulsed Plasma Mode. This can only be done in flight by an Engineer on EVA, but you can temporarily switch modes in the VAB/SPH to properly design your vessel.
- Retuned ISP for Pulsed Plasma Mode.

Fusion Reactors
- Replaced WB-2 particle effects with specular map to improve game performance.
- Added WB-1 Mandarin 1.25m fusion reactor.
- Added WB-MF Micro Fusion Reactor. It is a 0.625m fusion reactor.

Hex Trusses

- Had to remove CrossFeedEnabler from HexPorts due to lag issues. :(

Bug Fixes
- ArcJet motors now properly request ElectricCharge from the vessel.
- Fixed an issue where radiators were not taking on heat properly.
- Radiators now properly request electrical charge from the vessel.
- When selecting Toggle Engine or Activate Engine from an action group, the Supernova's flame effects will now appear properly.
- Cleaned up the Action Group items for the Supernova.
NOTE: You might need to redo your action groups.

Other
- Discovery II reference design added to the DSEV/ReferenceDesigns folder. This is a .craft file that you can use in your own saves. Simply copy the .craft file to the KerbalSpaceProgram/Ships/VAB folder.


0.3.20: Bug Stomping

Textures
- Converted all textures to dds format.

ISP Enhancements
- Buffed Supernova ISP to 35,000 sec.
- Buffed ArcJet RCS thrusters to 5,000 sec.
- Buffed "Ace" ArcJet engine to 5,000 sec.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Liquid Hydrogen is not particularly dense so you need a lot of it to get deltaV comparable to stock LiquidFuel. Plan your vessels accordingly. The game changes that affected the way how engines compute fuel use, combined with the CRP's move from 5L units to 1L units, has resulted in major tweaks needed for ISP. Remember, you can always use the MM_LiquidFuel patch to convert the ArcJect RCS thrusters, ArcJet engine, and Supernova to use LiquidFuel.

ISRU
- The Compact ISRU now produces: LH2, Monoprop, LiquidFuel, Oxidizer, LFO, Coolant, and FusionPellets.
- The Compact ISRU now costs more.

Fuel Tanks
- Multipurpose Storage Tanks will supply their resources if radially attached to other tanks, courtesy of CrossFeedEnabler.

WB-2 Fusion Reactor
- The reactor may now be started through staging.
- If the reactor doesn't have enough ElectricCharge to start then it is now smart enough to not drain the ship's electricity.

Supernova
- Added normal map.
- Added animated heat.

Masscon
- Removed Masscon resource in favor of an editor window that lets you enter the part's desired mass.
- The masscon part is slightly larger than before.

Resources
- Removed Masscon resource as it's no longer needed.

Docking Ports
- When you select a HexPort on the target vessel and Set As Target, it will light up automatically, turning off other lit HexPorts.
- HexPort now provides fuel cross-feeding, courtesy of CrossFeedEnabler. No more fuel line trickery needed! :)

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where the orange Multipurpose Storage Tanks would not remember what size they were.
- Fixed an issue where tank decals refused to hide themselves as directed.
- Fixed an issue where radiators would explode during high timewarp.
- Fixed an issue where the Supernova wasn't showing all of its engine flame effects.


0.3.19: Hotfix
- The Supernova now properly shows its engine flame.
- The Ace ArcJet is now the little engine that can (it works now).
- You can no longer toggle a tank diameter if you have parts attached to it.
- The resource panel now updates properly when you switch resources.


0.3.18: Maddening Heat Part 2

Heat Management
- Improved game performance for heat management.
- Vessels will no longer be cooled to just a few degrees above absolute zero while in space.
- You can now specify a default target temperature for the entire vessel as well as for individual parts.
See the config file for the WB-2 fusion reactor for an example.
- Radiators now support multiple coolant resources.
- Radiators now support coolant loss while under accelleration.
- Radiators now require ElectricCharge to keep running.
- Tuned the Supernova and WB-2 thermal outputs. Better have at least a dozen large radiators if you have the fusion engine aboard...
NOTE: KSP may crash if you have the built-in thermal warning running when the radiators reach maximum. It appears to be game related.
I suggest you turn off the temperature warning using F10.

Career
- Redistributed the parts into the new tech tree.

Engines
- Added surface effects to the Supernova.
- Added "Ace" ArcJet Rocket Motor.

ISRU
- Added Water and Minerals detection to the stock scanners.
- Added Water and Minerals extraction to the stock drill.

- Removed liquid hydrogen and fusion pellet generation from stock ISRU.

Multipurpose Storage Tanks
- Added Water, Minerals, and Ore storage templates.

Other
- Added Masscon Ballast Module.
- Added Masscon resource. It literally weighs a ton! (1 ton per unit)

0.3.17: Active Radiators! (and Moar Tanks)
IMPORTANT NOTES
- This update will break your saves. Please retire any vessels in flight.
- Please redo action groups for your VAB/SPH vehicle's radiator panels as these will have changed since last update.
- The Centrifuge ring and countertorque ring use the latest InfernalRobotics mod; please set up your action groups accordingly.
- Heat management is a work in progress. The radiators DO work and keep your craft cool! :) But more tuning is needed. Right now
the Fusion Reactor and Supernova engine heat production is dialed back until I find the right balance.

Thank you Red Iron Crown and NathanKell for your valuable information on the new heat mechanics! :)

Gameplay
- Recompiled for KSP 1.0
- Added new part category for DSEV.

Fuel Tanks
- Removed the old fusion pellet tanks.
- Added the FLM-900 Multipurpose Storage Tank. It's a half-sized version of the FLM-1800 designed to fit the half-hex truss.
- Added the FLM-14400, FLM-7200, and FLM-3600 Multipurpose Storage Tanks. These massive orange tanks are able to hold different resources, and you can toggle their diameters from 3.75m to 2.5m.
- The resource storage templates are now based upon 1L units, in-line with the revisions to Community Resource Pack. Now you can hold more stuff!
- Added the Coolant storage template.

ISRU
- Added liquid hydrogen creation to the stock ISRU.
- Added FusionPellets creation to the stock ISRU.

Power & Heat management
- The Fusion Reactor now uses the stock resource generator.
- The radiators now provide active and passive heat radiation. You can also vent coolant (open-cycle cooling mode) to shed heat more rapidly. 
- Radiators now start to glow red based upon temperature more accurately.
NOTE: More heat management is on the way.

Bug Fixes & Enhancements
- Fixed an issue where the fusion reactor and Supernova engine would not remember that they were activated.
- Fixed an issue with the ArcJet RCS thrusters not shutting off via action groups.
- Fixed an issue with the ArcJet RCS thrusters still showing stock thrust effects.
- ArcJet and Supernova now use liquid hydrogen by default (previously it was liquid fuel, with a liquid hydrogen switch if Near Future Propulsion was installed). Rename MM_LiquidFuel.txt to MM_LiquidFuel.cfg if you want them to use LiquidFuel instead.
- Removed SpinHub plugin in favor of latest Infernal Robotics 0.20c.


0.3.16: Maddening Heat Part 1
- Temporarily disabled heat management while I'm redesigning the heat management system. It will be back for 1.0

0.3.15: Moar Thrusters
- Improved engine thrust on the Supernova. Hydrogen mode thrust has been increased to 900, up from 600. Pulsed Plasma mode is now 650, up from 150.
- Supernova now consumes fewer FusionPellets when idling.
- WB-2 reactor will start idling when its EC resource is full. When idling, it consumes fewer pellets.
- The WB-2 reactor shows how much EC it produces when running.
- Added the RT-5 ArcJet RCS Thruster. It offers RCS thrust in 5 directions for more epicness.
- Reduced the thrust power on the ArcJet RCS thrusters to 1.2kn (half what it was before and more in line with stock RCS).
- ArcJets require 150 EC/sec.
- The ArcJet RCS thrusters can be started, stopped, and toggled through Action Groups.
- Added the WBR-12M Radiator, a small radiator for the fusion reactor. It needs more artwork but it is functional.
- Radiators now measure in terms of Celsius (C) instead of speed of light (c). It's still better than negative Kelvin... ;)

0.3.14: Tanks For The Memories 0.90
- Added the FLM-100 radial storage tank. It slipped into the last update, so it's now officially ready for use.
- Deprecated the WB-120 radial fusion pellet tank.
- Removed the SpareParts storage template. Fixing DSEV vessels will require RocketParts (which, if you have Extraplanetary Launchpads, can be used to build rockets).
- Fixed an issue where the ArcJet RCS would still act like it is firing even when disabled.
- Fixed an issue where the HexPort allowed you to toggle the vestibule while in flight.
- Fixed an issue where the double hex truss allowed you to toggle the center vestibule while in flight.

0.3.13: Broken Wings (https://youtu.be/nKhN1t_7PEY)
- Truncated the Large Graphene Radiator to 3 segments instead of 5.
NOTE: With the smaller radiator size, you'll need 14 radiators instead of 10 to cool the Supernova at full thrust. Be sure to build new ships accordingly.

0.3.12: Like A Record Baby

Hex Trusses
- Added a configurable Hex Node. You can toggle the side attachment nodes and switch between open frame (default), bracing, and pressurized crew tubes.

Centrifuge
- Retextured the Spindle. No more primary colors!

Other
- Added MiniAVC support

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue preventing the proper number of equipment racks from showing on the hex trusses during flight.
- Fixed an issue allowing the double-hex truss's center vestibule to be toggled during flight.

0.3.11: Moar Jungle Gyms

Hex Trusses
- Added the double-sized hex truss.
- Hex trusses have additional cross bracing to prevent eye strain. No more escher trusses!
- Hex trusses can be toggled in the editor to have three types of end caps: Open, Braced, and Vestibule. Open is the default.
- Hex trusses can be toggled in the editor to have 2, 3, 6, and no equipment racks. Two racks is the default.
  NOTE: If you have 6 equipment racks then you won't be able to access any equipment installed inside the truss.
- Hex trusses can be hidden if you have Near Future Construction installed (which has a better selection of trusses). simply rename MM_Hex.txt to MM_Hex.cfg.

FLM-1800 Multipurpose Storage Tank
- To prevent accidental dumping of resources during flight, the storage tank now requires a confirmation click to change the stored resource type.

Docking Ports
- The glow-rings on the HexPort and 3.75m Docking Ring can now be toggled in flight or in the editor.

Supernova
- If the Supernova is staged before starting the reactor, then the reactor will be automatically started and the capacitor will begin charging.
- After the capacitor is fully charged, the engine will automatically activate.
- If the Supernova can't get enough electric charge while charging the reactor, then it will switch off the reactor to prevent the ship from becoming E.C. starved.
- The Start Reactor button has been renamed Start Engine.
- The Stop Reactor button has been renamed Shutdown Engine.
- Added engine temperature readout in Celsius.
- Removed the Activate button from the context menu.
- Removed extra Shutdown Engine button from the context menu.
- Removed the automatic mode switching button from the context menu.

Other
- Removed the Nuclear Aerospike. Be sure to retire any spacecraft that use the aerospike before installing this update.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue with the Supernova where staging to activate the engine before starting the reactor would cause the engine to overheat. Thanks for the debug logs, Kamuchi! :)
- Fixed an issue where the Supernova could be activated without starting the reactor, thus bypassing heat management. Thanks for the playtest, BuzZBladE! :)
- Synchronized ship-wide heat generation and heat radiation via a centralized heat manager. This might actually improve performance as well. 
  NOTE: radiators will still have different temperatures due to the way the game heats up nearby parts and dissipates heat.
- Fixed an issue preventing the ArcJet RCS Thruster from firing when a ship is equipped with fuel pipes.
- The WB-120 GrapheneRadiator now shows temperature in Celsius instead of Kelvin. It actually already was showing Celsius, but the label said Kelvin. No more temperatures below absolute zero!
- The 3.75m docking ring now shows the correct names for the variant button (Open, Vestibule), and no longer shows the Previous Variant button.
- Fixed an issue where the 3.75m docking ring would show the variant button while in flight.

Special thanks to DasValdez, Kamuchi, BuzZBladE and the viewers of KSPTV for providing vital feedback and testing. It really helped to see the mod in use and to see what worked and what needed improvements. :)

0.3.10: Bug Fixes
- Added safety feature to prevent heat radiators from exploding when they take on too much heat from reactors and engines.

0.3.9: It's Not A Jungle Gym
- Added the Hexagonal Truss. The truss segment is based on the design from NASA's Discovery II paper and is sized the same as a Near Future Construction's Octo-truss by Nertea to accommodate octo-standard 1.875m by 4m truss payloads.
- Added the Half-sized Hexagonal Truss. It is based on the design from NASA's Discovery II paper and can accommodate 1.875 by 2m truss payloads.
- Added the HexPort hexagonal docking port. It is compatible with the Clamp-O-Tron Sr. Thank you for the tips, sumghai and nil2work!
NOTE: MM configs hide the hex truss, half-hex truss, and HexPort if Near Future Construction is installed since NFC has a much better selection of parts. Delete the MM_Hex.cfg file in the DSEV folder if you still want to use them.
- Added the 3.75m docking ring.
- Added the WB-2 MHD Fusion Reactor.
- Added the RT-4 ArcJet Reaction Control Thruster. It's like a Place-Anywhere 7, but it uses LiquidFuel (LiquidHydrogen if Near Future Propulsion is installed)- and a lot of power.
- Tweaked resource densities for Glykerol and FusionPellets. Thanks Nertea for the new values!
- Parts now support Community Tech Tree if installed.

0.3.8: You Spin Me Right Round
- Added the Spindle, Spin Ring, and Counter Torque Ring based upon ZodiusInfuser/Sirkut's rotating space station hub.
- Added SpinHub plugin to gently accelerate/decelerate the hubs, provide context menu and Action Group support, and to prevent ship breakage when in timewarp.
NOTE: Infernal Robotics required to make the hubs spin. Get it here: http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/37707-0-90-Magic-Smoke-Industries-Infernal-Robotics-0-19-3
This was so frustrating to do, it deserves a YouTube video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGNiXGX2nLU

0.3.7: Stefan-Boltzmann
- Updated the radiator code to use the Stefan-Boltzman law of radiation. Heat convection still not supported, for that you might check out SystemHeat by Nertea.

0.3.6: Hot Fire
- Rebranded the mod as Deep Space Exploration Vessels
- Deprecated the Nuclear Aerospike engine
- Added the WBR-120 Graphene Radiator
- Added the FLM-1800 Multipurpose Storage Tank. Right-click the tank to store a variety of different resources. Right-click to change the endcaps when in the editor. This 1.875m tank fits inside the hollow octo-truss from Near Future Construction and can be radially attached.
- The Supernova now requires radiators to function properly. You can disable heat management for the engine by right-clicking the engine and accessing the debug window.
- The Supernova now requires 48,000 EC to start the reactor before the engine can be used. Right-click the part to start the reactor. The EC startup requirement can be disabled in the debug menu.
- The Supernova now has a debug menu. Right-click the part to access the menu. Pressing Debug Reset will remove any overheating, clear out the heat sink, shut off the reactor, and reset a few internal variables so the engine appears as if it just left the VAB/Hangar.

NOTE: Existing spacecraft built prior to 0.3.6 should not be affected by the changes but just in case, use the debug menu to disable heat management and the EC startup requirement.

IMPORTANT NOTE: To install the mod, DELETE the existing GameData/WildBlueIndustries/NuclearEngine folder before installing DSEV. Be sure to copy ALL the files provided into the GameData folder.

FYI: It would be a good idea for new spacecraft built with this version of the mod to stock up on SpareParts...

0.3.5: Recompiled for 0.9.0 Beta. Added Modular Fuel Tanks config (thanks Kolago. :) ). Completely redesigned the mod's code to improve maintainability - I learned a LOT from Multipurpose Colony Modules!
- Supernova now has two modes: hydrogen mode and pulsed plasma mode. Hydrogen mode burns LiquidFuel as its propellant, unless you have Near Future Propulsion (NFP) installed. If you have NFP, then hydrogen mode burns LiquidHydrogen.
- Nuclear Aerospike now only burns LFO, but it offers superior thrust compared to the LV-N.

0.3.2: Improved plasma fusion flame effect. Added engine sounds. Code cleanup. Consolidated textures where possible; main textures are in the Textures folder while individual models have placeholders.

0.3.1: Added SupernovaController module. Modified MultiFuelSwitcher to support particle effects. Added custom flame effects for the Supernova's pulsed plasma mode, liquid fuel NTR mode, and liquid hydrogen NTR mode.

0.3: Added emissives to aerospike engine. Added initial version of Supernova as well as the large fusion pellet tank. Added FuelRods and FusionPellets resources.

0.2.3: Refactored controller module into MultiFuelSwitcher. Got curious about how R.A.P.I.E.R. engine switched fuel modes. Discovered MultiModeEngine. Said Ugh.
Realized that MultiModeEngine only allows two fuel modes, whereas MultiFuelSwitcher allows many. Cheered. :) Discovered new module fx controller and realized that engine effects can be set by fuel type, including sounds.

0.2: Fixed fuel gauge display bug. Finished aerospike model and textures. Added ISP and thrust modifiers to propellant list. Rebalanced engine stats based upon fuel types.

0.1: Initial revision
